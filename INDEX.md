#   Implementations of pPEG

This index has links to a number of pPEG implementations in different languages.

Implementing pPEG is a fun project, and there is plenty of scope for new implementations in new programming languages, or with different and better implementations.

If you have a new implementation that you would like to share I would be delighted to add it into this index.

## JavaScript

The original implementation of pPEG at: <https://github.com/pcanz/pPEGjs>

## Prolog

An implementatin in SWI Prolog: <https://github.com/ridgeworks/pPEGpl>

## Python

Under construction...

## GO

Still to come...

## Rust

Hopefully a very fast parser, still under construction....
