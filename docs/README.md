#   pPEG Documents

To find out what pPEG is all about the palce to satrt is the [README] in the top level direcory. This has references to documents here for further explination.

Specific details for how to use pPEG implementations in different programming laanguages can be found in their own repositories with links form the [INDEX] in the top level directory.

The collection of documents in this directory covers some generic pPEG topics in more detail and adds general background information.

*   [Context-Sensitive-Grammars] discusses the use of extension functions to cope with gnarly syntax that is beyond a Context Free grammar and can not be specified with normal pPEG grammar rules.

*   [Operator-Expressions] explains how pPEG deals with operator expressions.

*   [Pratt-Parsing] provides information on the Pratt parsing algorithm.

*   [pPEG-Machine] is a guide to the design of a pPEG virtual machine. This is the place to go for anyone interested in implementing a pPEG parser of their own.
